    <p>Eggs Benedict is an American breakfast dish that consists of a split English muffin topped with Canadian bacon, a poached egg, and Hollandaise sauce. There are conflicting reports about the iconic breakfast’s origins, but most agree it was invented in New York City in the late 1800s (either at Delmonico’s or the Waldorf Hotel).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar</li>
        <li>8 eggs</li>
        <li>8 strips canadian-style bacon</li>
        <li>4 English muffins, split</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>To poach the eggs: Fill a large saucepan with 2 to 3 inches of water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, pour in vinegar, and keep water at a gentle simmer. Crack an egg into a small bowl then gently slip egg into simmering water, holding the bowl just above the surface of water. Repeat with the remaining eggs. Cook eggs until whites are firm and yolks have thickened but are not hard, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes. Remove eggs from water with a slotted spoon, dab on a kitchen towel to remove excess water, and place onto a warm plate.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Brown bacon in a medium skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>To serve eggs Benedict: Spread toasted muffins with softened butter and top each one with a slice of bacon, followed by one poached egg. Place 2 muffins on each plate and drizzle with Hollandaise sauce. Sprinkle with chopped chives and serve immediately.
